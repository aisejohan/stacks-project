\section{Introduction}
\label{section-introduction}

\noindent
In this chapter we briefly explain how to get a theory of relative cycles
very similar to the one in \cite{SV}; the precise relationship between the
definitions will be explained in Remark \ref{remark-compare-SV}.



\section{Cycles relative to fields}
\label{section-relative-fields}

\noindent
Let $k$ be a field. Let $X$ be a locally algebraic scheme over $k$.
Let $r \geq 0$ be an integer. In this setting we have the group
$Z_r(X)$ of $r$-cycles on $X$.

\medskip\noindent
Change of fields. For any field extension $k'/k$ there is a base change or
pullback map $Z_r(X) \to CH_r(X_{k'})$, see
Chow Homology, Section \ref{chow-section-change-base}.
Briefly, given an integral closed subscheme $Z \subset X$
of dimension $r$ we send $[Z] \in Z_r(X)$ to the $r$-cycle
$[Z_{k'}]_r \in Z_r(X_{k'})$ associated to the closed subscheme
$Z_{k'} \subset X_{k'}$ (of course in general $Z_{k'}$
is neither irreducible nor reduced).

\begin{remark}
\label{remark-how-different}
Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p$ with perfect closure $k^{perf}$.
Let $X$ be a locally algebraic scheme over $k$. Let $r \geq 0$ be an integer.
The map
$$
Z_r(X) \otimes_\mathbf{Z} \mathbf{Z}[1/p]
\longrightarrow
Z_r(X_{k^{perf}}) \otimes_\mathbf{Z} \mathbf{Z}[1/p]
$$
is an isomorphism. Even the example of $X = \mathbf{A}^1_k$
over $k = \mathbf{F}_p(t)$ shows that the cokernel of
$Z_r(X) \to Z_r(X_{k^{perf}})$ is not annihilated by any
fixed power of $p$.
\end{remark}

\section{Families of cycles on fibres}
\label{section-cycles-fibres}

\noindent
Let $f : X \to S$ be a morphism of schemes which is locally of finite type.
Let $r \geq 0$ be an integer. A {\it family of $r$-cycles on fibres}
$\alpha$ is a family
$$
\alpha = (\alpha_s)_{s \in S}
$$
indexed by the points $s$ of the scheme $S$ where
$$
\alpha_s \in Z_r(X_{\kappa(s)^{perf}})
\quad\text{with}\quad
X_{\kappa(s)^{perf}} = X_s \times_{\Spec(\kappa(s))} \Spec(\kappa(s)^{perf})
$$
is an $r$ cycle on the scheme theoretic fibre over the perfection of
the residue field. There are various constructions we can perform on
families of $r$-cycles on fibres.

\medskip\noindent
Base change. Let
$$
\xymatrix{
X' \ar[r] \ar[d] & X \ar[d] \\
S' \ar[r]^g & S
}
$$
be a catesian square of morphisms of schemes with $f$ locally of finite type.
Let $r \geq 0$ be an integer. Given a family of $r$-cycles $\alpha$
on $X/S$ we define the {\it base change} $g^*\alpha$ of $\alpha$
to be the family
$$
g^*\alpha = (\alpha'_{s'})_{s' \in S'}
$$
where $\alpha'_{s'} \in Z_r(X'_{\kappa(s')^{perf}})$ is the base change
(or pullback) of the cycle $\alpha_s$ with $s' = g(s)$ as in
Section \ref{section-relative-fields} via the identitification
$$
X'_{\kappa(s')^{perf}} =
X_{\kappa(s)^{perf}} \times_{\Spec(\kappa(s)^{perf})} \Spec(\kappa(s')^{perf})
$$
of scheme theoretic fibres.

\medskip\noindent
Restriction. Let $f : X \to S$ be a morphism of schemes which is locally
of finite type. Let $r \geq 0$ be an integer. Let $U \subset X$ be an open
subscheme. Given a family of $r$-cycles $\alpha$ on $X/S$ we can define
the {\it restriction} $\alpha|_U$ of $\alpha$ to be the family
$$
\alpha|_U = (\alpha_s|_{U_{\kappa(s)^{perf}}})_{s \in S}
$$
of restrictions to scheme theoretic fibres.

\medskip\noindent
Flat pullback. Let $f : X \to S$ be a morphism of schemes which is locally
of finite type. Let $r \geq 0$ be an integer. Let $h : X' \to X$ be a
flat morphism, locally of finite type, and of relative dimension $e$.
Let $r \geq 0$ be an integer. Given a family of $r$-cycles $\alpha$
on $X/S$ we define the {\it flat pullback} $h^*\alpha$ of $\alpha$
to be the family of $(r + e)$-cycles on fibres
$$
h^*\alpha = (\alpha'_s)_{s \in S}
$$
where $\alpha'_s \in Z_{r + e}(X'_{\kappa(s)^{perf}})$ is the flat pullback
of the cycle $\alpha_s$ in $Z_r(X_{\kappa(s)^{perf}})$ by the flat morphism
$f_{\kappa(s)^{perf}} : X_{\kappa(s)^{perf}} \to X_{\kappa(s)^{perf}}$
of scheme theoretic fibres.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-pullback-universally-bijective}
Let $g : S' \to S$ be a universally bijective morphism of schemes.
Let $f : X \to S$ be locally of finite type. Set $X' = S' \times_S X$.
Let $r \geq 0$. Then base change by $g$ determines a bijection
between the group of families of $r$-cycles $\alpha$ on $X/S$ and
the group of families of $r$-cycles $\alpha$ on $X'/S'$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Holds because $g$ induces a bijection on points and isomorphisms
on perfect closures of residue fields.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-family-associated-module}
Let $f : X \to S$ be a morphism of schemes which is locally of finite type.
Let $r \geq 0$ be an integer. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a quasi-coherent
$\mathcal{O}_X$-module of finite type. For $s \in S$ denote $\mathcal{F}_s$
and $\mathcal{F}_{\kappa(s)^{perf}}$
the pullback of $\mathcal{F}$ to $X_s$ and $X_{\kappa(s)^{perf}}$.
Assume $\dim(\text{Supp}(\mathcal{F}_s)) \leq r$ for all $s \in S$.
Then we can associate to $\mathcal{F}$ the family of relative
$r$-cycles $[\mathcal{F}/X/S]_r$ defined by the formula
$$
[\mathcal{F}/X/S]_r = ([\mathcal{F}_{\kappa(s)^{perf}}]_r)_{s \in S}
$$
where $[\mathcal{F}_{\kappa(s)^{perf}}]_r$ is given by
Chow Homology, Definition
\ref{chow-definition-cycle-associated-to-coherent-sheaf}.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-family-associated-module}
The construction in Example \ref{example-family-associated-module}
is compatible with base change, restriction,
and flat pullback.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
\label{example-family-associated-closed}
Let $f : X \to S$ be a morphism of schemes which is locally of finite type.
Let $r \geq 0$ be an integer. Let $Z \subset X$ be a closed subscheme.
For $s \in S$ denote $Z_s$ and $Z_{\kappa(s)^{perf}}$
the inverse image of $Z$ in $X_s$ and $X_{\kappa(s)^{perf}}$.
Assume $\dim(Z_s) \leq r$ for all $s \in S$.
Then we can associate to $Z$ the family of relative
$r$-cycles $[Z/X/S]_r$ defined by the formula
$$
[Z/X/S]_r = ([Z_{\kappa(s)^{perf}}]_r)_{s \in S}
$$
where $[Z_{\kappa(s)^{perf}}]_r$ is given by
Chow Homology, Definition
\ref{chow-definition-cycle-associated-to-closed-subscheme}.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-family-associated-closed}
The construction in Example \ref{example-family-associated-closed}
is compatible with base change, restriction,
and flat pullback.
\end{lemma}
